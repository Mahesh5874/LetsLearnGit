git checkout <commit hashcode/branch name>

    It can be understood as the method of selecting the current line

Branch
    - In Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. 
    Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. 
    When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or 
    how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.

git branch <branch-name>
    - to create a new branch

git merge <branch-name>
